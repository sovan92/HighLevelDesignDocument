# Caching 
- Gobal Caching
- In process caching
-    Cache data right inside a a process . By passes a network hop. (Mintrade off , on server caches something , others don't see it.  ) 
-    Cache config data or look up table .
-    CDN - content delivery networks(Putting servers in the world as the network needs them)
-    Client side caching
-        - If there is a offline functionality (least important to know)
- Cache Aside (Cache HIT )
-     Only cache the data that user requested.
-     Application checks the cache first . If not available , bring data from database and then puts data into cache. ) 
- Write Through Caching 
-     Write to cache then write to DB , then return to the user . (Not supported in redis and memcache, so it's is done by Spring cache, Hazel Cache. )
-     Dual Write problem ,
-         - Fancy rewrite .
-         - Slower write.
-         - Bloating the cache everytime . 
- Write Behid
-     Write to the cache ..
-     Write to the DB is in batches .
-     High write throughput is important .
-     This is used in analytics pipeline.
- Read through
-     Read from the cache , if it miss, then go to the database. (It' can be used for CDN)
- Eviction policy
-     What to keep and what to remove. 
-     least recently used (LRU)  - 
-     least frequently used (LFU)  - Only used once.
-     First in first out (Queue)
-     TTL - user sessions, API response. (Super common. )
- Uneven loads
- Cache Stampede (Thundering herd problem )
-     One query converts to 1000 database calls.
